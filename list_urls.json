However, currently available non-invasive mouse models utilize myeloid-specific reporters that are significantly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells as well as lymphoid compartments. Here, we describe a myeloid-specific marker that is not shared by any other lineage. We show that lactotransferrin mRNA is expressed by Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) cells in the bone marrow, as opposed to hematopoietic stem cells or any peripheral cell population. To follow the progeny of lactotransferrin-expressing bone marrow cells, we generated a mouse model in which a reporter gene is irreversibly activated from the lactotransferrin-promoter. We found that lactotransferrin-reporter labels a majority of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and distinct subtypes of dendritic cells, while excluding T, B, natural killer cells, interferon-producing killer dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, erythrocytes and eosinophils. Lactotransferrin-reporter(-) bone marrow cells retain lymphoid, erythroid and long-term repopulating potential, while lactotransferrin-reporter(+) bone marrow cells confer only myeloid, but not lymphoid potential. We conclude that lactotransferrin represents a late stage differentiation marker of neutrophils, macrophages and distinct subtypes of dendritic cells. ",

                    "context": "Patient phenotypes in pharmacological pain treatment varies between individuals, which could be partly assigned to their genotypes regarding the targets of classical analgesics (OPRM1, PTGS2) or associated signalling pathways (KCNJ6). Translational and genetic research have identified new targets, for which new analgesics are being developed. This addresses voltage-gated sodium, calcium and potassium channels, for which SCN9A, CACNA1B, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, respectively, are primary gene candidates because they code for the subunits of the respective channels targeted by analgesics currently in clinical development. Mutations in voltage gated transient receptor potential (TRPV) channels are known from genetic pain research and may modulate the effects of analgesics under development targeting TRPV1 or TRPV3. To this add ligand-gated ion channels including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors and ATP-gated purinergic P2X receptors with most important subunits coded by CHRNA4, GRIN2B and P2RX7. Among G protein coupled receptors, \u03b4-opioid receptors (coded by OPRD1), cannabinoid receptors (CNR1 and CNR2), metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5 coded by GRM5), bradykinin B(1) (BDKRB1) and 5-HT(1A) (HTR1A) receptors are targeted by new analgesic substances. Finally, nerve growth factor (NGFB), its tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK1) and the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) have become targets of interest. For most of these genes, functional variants have been associated with neuro-psychiatric disorders and not yet with analgesia. However, research on the genetic modulation of pain has already identified variants in these genes, relative to pain, which may facilitate the pharmacogenetic assessments of new analgesics. The increased number of candidate pharmacogenetic modulators of analgesic actions may open opportunities for the broader clinical implementation of genotyping information.Opioid receptors are currently classified as mu (mu: mOP), delta (delta: dOP), kappa (kappa: kOP) with a fourth related non-classical opioid receptor for nociceptin/orphainin FQ, NOP. Morphine is the current gold standard analgesic acting at MOP receptors but produces a range of variably troublesome side-effects, in particular tolerance. There is now good laboratory evidence to suggest that blocking DOP while activating MOP produces analgesia (or antinociception) without the development of tolerance. Simultaneous targeting of MOP and DOP can be accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs, (ii) administering one non-selective drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand. Bivalent ligands generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature. For example linking the MOP agonist oxymorphone to the DOP antagonist naltrindole produces a MOP/DOP bivalent ligand that should produce analgesia with reduced tolerance. The type of response/selectivity produced depends on the pharmacophore combination (e.g. oxymorphone and naltrindole as above) and the space between them. Production and evaluation of bivalent ligands is an emerging field in drug design and for anaesthesia, analgesics that are designed not to be highly selective morphine-like (MOP) ligands represents a new avenue for the production of useful drugs for chronic (and in particular cancer) pain.",

Baseline demographics, PFT, and chest CT were assessed before and after RTX. Two radiologists independently evaluated CT using a standardized scoring system.Twenty-five subjects at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (n = 13) and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (n = 12) were included. Antisynthetase antibodies were identified in all patients (16 Jo1, 6 PL-12, 3 PL-7). In 21 cases (84%), the principal indication for RTX use was recurrent or progressive ILD, owing to failure of other agents. Comparing pre- and post-RTX pulmonary variables at 12 months, CT score and forced vital capacity were stable or improved in 88% and 79% of subjects, respectively. Total lung capacity (%) increased from 56 \u00b1 13 to 64 \u00b1 13 and GC dose decreased from 18 \u00b1 9 to 12 \u00b1 12 mg/day. Although DLCO (%) declined slightly at 1 year, it increased from 42 \u00b1 17 to 70 \u00b1 20 at 3 years. The most common imaging patterns on CT were nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 13) and usual interstitial pneumonia/fibrotic NSIP (n = 5), of which 5 had concurrent elements of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.Stability or improvement in pulmonary function or severity of ILD on CT was seen in most patients. Use of RTX was well tolerated in the majority of patients. RTX may play a therapeutic role in patients with AS-ILD, and further clinical investigation is warranted.In the treatment of poly- and dermatomyositis, only a\u00a0limited number of treatment modalities are established.The goal of the GRAID-2 registry was to study off-label use of biologic drugs for this indication in Germany.Analysis of the data of the GRAID-2 registry for poly- and dermatomyositis.In 22\u00a0of the 23\u00a0patients in the GRAID-2 registry, rituximab (RIX) was administered, while 1\u00a0patient was given tocilizumab as off-label therapy. The 22\u00a0patients who received RIX treatment were analyzed. At the start of treatment, the following active manifestations were present: myositis (n\u00a0= 18), lung involvement (mainly interstitial lung disease; n\u00a0= 10), arthritis (n\u00a0= 10), skin manifestation (n\u00a0= 9), and Raynaud syndrome (n\u00a0= 5). Nine of the patients were Jo-1-antibody positive. All patients had previous treatments with multiple conventional immunosuppressive drugs. Treatment with RIX was given as infusions of 1\u2009g i.\u2009v., which were repeated after 2\u00a0weeks. Patients received a\u00a0mean of 3.09\u00a0\u00b1 2.27 infusions (equivalent to 1.5\u00a0cycles of 2\u00a0\u00d7 1\u2009g, max. 5\u00a0cycles). Tolerability of RIX treatment was rated as very good in 16\u00a0of 22\u00a0patients (72%), good in 5\u00a0(23%), and moderate in 1\u00a0(5%). In all, 27\u00a0adverse events were documented, with the majority being infections, whereby 2\u00a0severe infections occurred (6.59 per 100 patient-years). Eighty six percent of the patients showed complete remission of their myositis and 79% of their arthritis. The mean value of creatinine kinase in plasma fell from 1505\u00a0\u00b1 2534\u2009U/l before the start of treatment to 39\u00a0\u00b1 134\u2009U/l at the last visit. Regarding lung involvement, 1\u00a0of\u00a010 of the patients showed complete and 6\u00a0of\u00a010 partial remissions. In 2\u00a0of 10\u00a0patients, lung disease was stable during treatment.RIX is the preferred off-label biologic drug for poly- and dermatomyositis in Germany. In spite of a\u00a0strongly pretreated group of patients, the tolerability is acceptable, although the patient number in this investigation is small. Moreover, the results lead to the assumption that the majority of the patients had a\u00a0good or even very good therapeutic response to RIX.Rituximab (RTX) may be a treatment option for children and young people with JIA, although it is not licensed for this indication. The aim of this study was to describe RTX use and outcomes among children with JIA.This analysis included all JIA patients within the UK Biologics for Children with Rheumatic Diseases study starting RTX. Disease activity was assessed at RTX start and at follow-up. The total number of courses each patient received was assessed. Serious infections and infusion reactions occurring following RTX were reported.Forty-one JIA patients starting RTX were included, the majority with polyarthritis: polyarthritis RF negative [n = 14 (35%)], polyarthritis RF positive [n = 13 (33%)] and extended oligoarthritis [n = 9 (23%)]. Most were female (80%) with a median age of 15 years [interquartile range (IQR) 12-16] and a median disease duration of 9 years (IQR 5-11). The median improvement in the clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (cJADAS; three-variable 71-joint JADAS) from RTX start was 9 units (n = 7; IQR -14-2). More than half reported more than one course of RTX. The median time between each course was 219 days (IQR 198-315). During follow-up, 17 (41%) patients reported switching to another biologic, including tocilizumab (n = 8), abatacept (n = 6) and TNF inhibitor (n = 3). Three patients (7%) reported a serious infection on RTX (rate of first serious infection 6.2/100 person-years). Four patients (10%) reported an infusion reaction.This real-world cohort of children with JIA, the majority with polyarticular or extended oligoarticular JIA, showed RTX may be an effective treatment option for children who do not respond to TNF inhibitor, with a low rate of serious infections on treatment.A number of new treatment options have recently emerged for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, including the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) delta isoform inhibitor idelalisib combined with rituximab, the Bcl-2 antagonist venetoclax, and the new anti-CD20 antibodies obinutuzumab and ofatumumab. Most of these agents are already included into treatment algorithms defined by international practice guidelines, but more clinical investigations are needed to answer still remaining questions. Ibrutinib was proven as a primary choice for patients with the TP53 gene deletion/mutation, who otherwise have no active treatment available. Idelalisib with rituximab is also an active therapy, but due to increased risk of serious infections, its use in first-line treatment is limited to patients for whom ibrutinib is not an option. A new indication for ibrutinib was recently approved for older patients with comorbidities, as an alternative to the already existing indication for chlorambucil with obinutuzumab. The use of kinase inhibitors is already well established in recurrent/refractory disease. Immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) remains a major first-line option for many CLL patients without the TP53 gene deletion/mutation, and who have no significant comorbidities or history of infections, and is particularly effective in patients with favorable features including mutated IGHV status. There are a number of issues regarding novel therapies for CLL that need further investigation such as optimum duration of treatment with kinase inhibitors, appropriate sequencing of novel agents, mechanisms of resistance to inhibitors and response to class switching after treatment failure, along with the potential role of combinations of targeted agents.BackgroundPemphigus foliaceus (PF) is a blistering disorder most commonly presenting in middle age. As PF is restricted to the superficial epidermis, it is considered more benign than other pemphigus diseases. However, progression to severe disease is not uncommon. Although rituximab's efficacy has been well-documented in adults with refractory PF, little data is available on its role in adolescents.PurposeWe describe a patient with juvenile PF treated with rituximab and review the literature for similar cases.MethodsPubMed was searched for the terms: antibody, B cells, blistering, CD20, foliaceus, juvenile, pemphigus, rituximab, immunosuppression. As the first reported case of rituximab treated pemphigus was in 2001, only cases from 2001 and after were included. Juvenile PF was defined as disease diagnosis between ages 12-17.ResultsFive cases have been reported. The indication for rituximab in most cases was refractory PF unresponsive to systemic glucocorticoids and non-steroidal adjuvant therapies. All cases demonstrated significant improvement or complete remission and most experienced no adverse events.ConclusionsRituximab appears to be both well tolerated and efficacious for refractory juvenile PF. Therefore, it may be considered for severe cases of PF to avoid side effects associated with conventional glucocorticoid therapy.",

Our objectives were to assess the rate of rituximab prescription in patients with multiple sclerosis in Sweden and, in addition, to evaluate the safety of rituximab in a single centre for patients with multiple sclerosis.Review of the Swedish MS register was performed to study the number of MS patients treated with rituximab during the last 6\u00a0years. Investigation also included a retrospective review of medical files in search for possible side effects/adverse events in all adult patients with MS treated with rituximab at Uppsala University Hospital.Presently, in Sweden the rate of rituximab prescriptions in relation to other annually started of disease- modifying drugs in MS is 53.5%.The share of MS patients in Sweden who are treated with rituximab is very high, and also rapidly increasing. Taken into account the off-label use, cases with adverse medical conditions that could possibly be related to rituximab use should be reported thoroughly.Rituximab, an anti-CD20 B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody, is increasingly prescribed off-label for a range of autoimmune diseases. There has not previously been an audit of off-label rituximab use in the Northern Territory, where the majority of patients are Aboriginal.To evaluate retrospectively off-label rituximab use in autoimmune diseases in the Top End of the Northern Territory.We performed a retrospective audit of 8 years of off-label rituximab use at the Royal Darwin Hospital, the sole tertiary referral centre for the Darwin, Katherine and East Arnhem regions. Electronic and paper records were reviewed for demographic information, diagnosis/indication for rituximab, doses, previous/concomitant immunosuppression, clinical outcomes and specific adverse events.Rituximab was prescribed off-label to 66 patients for 24 autoimmune diseases. The majority of patients (62.1%) were Aboriginal and 60.6% female. The most common indications were refractory/relapsing disease despite standard therapies (68.7%) or severe disease with rituximab incorporated into an induction immunosuppressive regimen (19.4%). Systemic lupus erythematosus was the underlying diagnosis in 28.8% of cases. A clinically significant response was demonstrated in 74.2% of cases overall. There were 18 clinically significant infections; however, 13 were in patients receiving concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. There was a total of nine deaths from any cause.Rituximab has been used off-label for a range of autoimmune diseases in this population with a high proportion of Aboriginal patients successfully and safely in the majority of cases.In patients with immune thrombocytopenia who do not adequately respond to first-line therapy, there is no clear consensus on which second-line therapy to initiate and when. This situation leads to suboptimal approaches, including prolonged exposure to treatments that are not intended for long-term use (eg, corticosteroids) and overuse of off-label therapies (eg, rituximab) while approved, more efficacious options exist. These approaches may not only fail to address symptoms and burden of disease, but may also worsen health-related quality of life. A better understanding of available second-line treatments may ensure best use of therapeutic options and thereby optimize patient outcomes.Conventional treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) is associated with damage accrual, hence increased morbidity rate. Off-label use of rituximab (RTX) has shown significant promise in this patient group; however, data are still controversial. We aimed to analyze the outcomes of RTX therapy in refractory lupus using a meta-analysis approach.Electronic search of the medical literature was conducted using a combination of relevant keywords to retrieve studies on the safety and efficacy of RTX in SLE and LN patients. Results were screened against our inclusion and exclusion criteria and two reviewers independently extracted the data for analysis. Comprehensive meta-analysis software was used to pool the data from individual studies and provide summary effect estimates.Thirty-one studies that enrolled 1112 patients were finally eligible for the meta-analysis. The overall global, complete, and partial response rates to RTX therapy were 72%, 46%, and 32%, respectively. RTX significantly decreased Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG) scores (p&lt;0.001). Prednisone dose was significantly reduced after RTX treatment in both SLE and LN groups (p&lt;0.001), and proteinuria was lowered in SLE (p&lt;0.001) than in LN patients (p=0.07). Infection and infusion-related reactions were the most common side effects.RTX therapy in refractory SLE and LN patients proved clinical efficacy and favorable safety outcomes. Larger well-designed randomized clinical trials are warranted.",

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the traditional use, phytochemistry, biological activity, cultivation, and extraction of Sideritis scardica and to highlight the gaps in our knowledge which deserves further research.The present review is based on information collected from scientific journals, books, and electronic search. These sources include Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google scholar as well as local books on ethnopharmacology and botany of this plant.The reported data on phytochemical studies, biological activity, cultivation, extraction, and traditional uses have been reviewed. Variability in essential oil composition of wild growing and cultivated taxa depending on ecological conditions was discussed. Flavonoids, phenylethanoids, diterpenoids, aliphatic compounds, etc. identified so far have been summarized. A comparative study on the effectiveness of different methods, solvents, and parameters of extraction has also been discussed. A broad range of activities of plant extracts and fractions as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, antioxidant, gastroprotective, antiglioma, and triple monoamine reuptake inhibition as well as cultivation of the species as an approach for conservation of the natural habitats and provision of herb with high and permanent quality has also been presented.Sideritis scardica has become very popular and widely advertised herb in Europe. Although some of ethnobotanical uses have been proved through in vitro experiments, further studies of the individual compounds or chemical class of compounds responsible for the pharmacological effects and the mechanisms of action are necessary. In addition, the toxicity and the side effects from the use of Sideritis scardica as well as clinical trails need attention. The variability in the chemical composition of this medicinal plant depending on the origin requires development of a protocol for its standardization. For the practice it is important to improve cultivation conditions in order to increase the accumulation of biologically active compounds and to obtain herb with permanent and good quality.",

A total of 150 soil samples were collected from public parks and playgrounds in various areas of Shiraz, southern Iran. The samples were treated with saturated zinc sulphate solution, and Toxocara spp. eggs were detected by microscopic observation followed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To differentiate T. canis and T. cati eggs from each other, PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA region by SalI endonuclease enzyme was used. PCR-sequencing was performed to confirm the results of the PCR-RFLP method. Based on the flotation results of the 150 soil samples, six (4%) were found to be positive for Toxocara spp. eggs, whereas nested-PCR showed 24 samples to be positive (16%). Based on the PCR-RFLP method and the sequence of the ITS-rDNA region, a total of 23 out of 24 isolates were confirmed as T. cati and one out of 24 as T. canis. The results showed a higher number of soil samples to be positive for Toxocara by the molecular method than microscopy, and higher T. cati infection in soil samples, which could have an important role in human infection with toxocariasis in this region.",

However, little is known about the effects and mechanisms of SST in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, a model of PD was generated by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats in order to investigate the effects of SST on LPS-induced degeneration of DA in vivo. Intramural injection of LPS resulted in a significant loss of DA neurons, while reduction of neuronal death by SST pretreatment was confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and Nissl. In parallel, immunohistochemical detection of OX-42 and hydroethidine staining were employed to determine the activation of microglia and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. It was found that SST inhibited the LPS-induced microglial activity and ROS production. ELISA revealed a decreased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 and prostaglandin E2 when SST was administered prior to LPS treatment. Western blot analysis showed that LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p-p65 was attenuated by administration of SST prior to LPS application. The results indicated that LPS-induced loss of nigral DA neurons was inhibited by SST and the observed effects of SST on neuroprotection were associated with suppression of microglial activation and the NF-\u03baB pathway, ensuing decreases of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The present study therefore suggested that SST is beneficial for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, through inhibiting the activation of microglia.Somatostatin (SST) is abundantly produced by the human retina, and the main source is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). SST exerts relevant functions in the retina (neuromodulation, angiostatic, and anti-permeability actions) by interacting with SST receptors (SSTR) that are also expressed in the retina. In the diabetic retina, a downregulation of SST production does exist. In this article, we give an overview of the mechanisms by which this deficit of SST participates in the main pathogenic mechanisms involved in diabetic retinopathy (DR): neurodegeneration, neovascularization, and vascular leakage. In view of the relevant SST functions in the retina and the reduction of SST production in the diabetic eye, SST replacement has been proposed as a new target for treatment of DR. This could be implemented by intravitreous injections of SST analogs or gene therapy, but this is an aggressive route for the early stages of DR. Since topical administration of SST has been effective in preventing retinal neurodegeneration in STZ-induced diabetic rats, it seems reasonable to test this new approach in humans. In this regard, the results of the ongoing clinical trial EUROCONDOR will provide useful information. In conclusion, SST is a natural neuroprotective and antiangiogenic factor synthesized by the retina which is downregulated in the diabetic eye and, therefore, its replacement seems a rational approach for treating DR. However, clinical trials will be needed to establish the exact position of targeting SST in the treatment of this disabling complication of diabetes.Somatostatin (Som), one of the most concentrated neuropeptides in the brain, is highly expressed in the olfactory bulb (OB). However, the temporal profile by which OB somatostatin-expressing (Som+) interneurons are produced and the molecular mechanisms controlling this profile are totally unknown. In the present study, we found that all the Som+ interneurons in the mouse external plexiform layer (EPL) and the rat glomerular layer (GL) express the transcription factor Sp8.Using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) birth dating method, combined with immunostaining, we showed that the generation of Som+ interneurons in the mouse and rat OB is confined to the later embryonic and earlier postnatal stages. Within the mouse OB, the production of Som+ interneurons is maximal during late embryogenesis and decreases after birth, whereas the generation of Som+ interneurons is low during embryogenesis and increases gradually after birth in the rat OB. Interestingly, genetic ablation of Sp8 by cre/loxP-based recombination severely reduces the number of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp8 is required for the normal production of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB. Immune privilege (IP) is believed to exist in the anagen hair follicle (HF). Studies have shown that downregulation of major histocompatibility complex Class I occurs and immunosuppressive factors are expressed in the HF bulb and bulge. However, demonstration and quantification of functional IP in HF cells are required. We examined the middle (sheath) and lower (bulb) portions of the human HF using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), immunohistology, ELISA, in vitro coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and flow cytometry. We found that HF cells, relative to non-follicular epidermal cells, failed to promote allogeneic PBMC proliferation and CD4(+) and CD8(+) IFN\u03b3 production. By qPCR, we found significant downregulation of Class I and Class II HLA alleles in both the bulb and sheath, and upregulation of multiple immunoregulatory genes. It is noteworthy that somatostatin (SST) was significantly upregulated relative to epidermis. By immunohistochemistry, SST was most strongly expressed in the HF outer root sheath, and, by ELISA, cultured sheath cells secreted SST. PBMCs, cultured with stimulatory allogeneic epidermal cells and SST, secreted significantly less IFN\u03b3 than controls. Addition of SST antagonists to PBMCs cocultured with allogeneic HF cells increased IFN\u03b3 secretion. The data identify SST as a secretory factor potentially contributing to the HF IP repertoire.The kinetics of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin release was studied in human pancreatic islets. Batches of 10-15 islets were perifused and the hormones measured with RIA in 30-sec fractions. Increase of glucose from 3 to 20 mm resulted in a brief pulse of glucagon coinciding with suppression of basal insulin and somatostatin release. There was a subsequent drop of glucagon release concomitant with the appearance of a pronounced pulse of insulin and a slightly delayed pulse of somatostatin. Continued exposure to 20 mm glucose generated pulsatile release of the three hormones with 7- to 8-min periods accounting for 60-70% of the secreted amounts. Glucose caused pronounced stimulation of average insulin and somatostatin release. However, the nadirs between the glucagon pulses were lower than the secretion at 3 mm glucose, resulting in 18% suppression of average release. The repetitive glucagon pulses were antisynchronous to coincident pulses of insulin and somatostatin. The resulting greater than 20-fold variations of the insulin to glucagon ratio might be essential for minute-to-minute regulation of the hepatic glucose production.",

Pasteurization may have detrimental effects on bioactivity, but more information is needed about its effects on the immunological compounds. Research aim: This work has two main aims: evaluate the antibody profile of colostrum and study the quantitative variations in the antibodies' level and specific reactivity after undergoing Holder pasteurization. The authors focused on immunoregulatory components of colostrum (antidietary antibodies and TGF-\u03b22) in the neonatal gut.This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 67 donated colostrum samples at different days after delivery, both raw and pasteurized. Antibody profiles were analyzed at different times during breastfeeding, and total and specific antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG subclasses) were compared with tetanus toxoid and ovalbumin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The processing effect on total and specific antibodies, as well as TGF-\u03b22, was evaluated by paired analyses.No variations in immunological compounds were observed throughout the colostrum stage. The TGF-\u03b22, antibodies' concentrations, and antibodies' specific reactivity after pasteurization did not vary significantly as days of lactation varied. Changes in antibody levels were dependent on isotype and IgG subclass, and IgG4 showed remarkable resistance to heating. Moreover, the effect of the pasteurization on specific reactivity was antigen dependent.The supply of relevant immunological components is stable throughout the colostrum stage. The effects of pasteurization on antibodies depend on isotype, subclass, and specificity. This information is relevant to improving the immunological quality of colostrum, especially for preterm newborns.",

This phospholipid elicits a wide range of cancer cell responses, such as proliferation, trans-differentiation, migration, and invasion, via various G-protein-coupled LPA receptors (LPARs). Here, we explored the cellular signaling pathway via which LPA induces migration of ovarian cancer cells. LPA induced robust phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, which are membrane-cytoskeleton linkers, in the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3. Among the LPAR subtypes expressed in these cells, LPAThis review deals with recent advances in studies on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and its expression regulators, focusing especially on our own research. Firstly, we describe findings demonstrating that the distribution of P-gp along the small intestine is heterogeneous, which explains why orally administered P-gp substrate drugs often show bimodal changes of plasma concentration. Secondly, we discuss the post-translational regulation of P-gp localization and function by the scaffold proteins ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM proteins), together with recent reports indicating that tissue-specific differences in regulation by ERM proteins in normal tissues might be retained in corresponding cancerous tissues. Thirdly, we review evidence that P-gp activity is enhanced in the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with cancer progression, without any increase in expression of P-gp mRNA. Finally, we describe two examples in which P-gp critically influences the brain distribution of drugs, i.e., oseltamivir, where low levels of P-gp associated with early development allow oseltamivir to enter the brain, potentially resulting in neuropsychiatric side effects in children, and cilnidipine, where impairment of P-gp function in ischemia allows cilnidipine to enter the ischemic brain, where it exerts a neuroprotective action.Leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) is absolutely fundamental to the inflammatory response, and involves initial pseudopod protrusion and subsequent polarised migration across inflamed endothelium.

Here we performed a microRNA microarray to identify the molecular causes of this cardiac phenotype that revealed the dysregulation of several microRNAs including miR-301a, which was highly downregulated in Cs1-ko mice compared to the wild-type littermates. Cofilin-2 (Cfl2) was identified as one of the potential targets of miR-301a using prediction databases, which we validated by luciferase assay and mutation of predicted binding sites. Furthermore, expression of miR-301a contrastingly regulated Cfl2 expression levels in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCM). Along these lines, Cfl2 was significantly upregulated in Cs1-ko mice, indicating the physiological association between miR-301a and Cfl2 in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that Cfl2 activated serum response factor response element (SRF-RE) driven luciferase activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and in C2C12 cells. Similarly, knockdown of miR301a activated, whereas, its overexpression inhibited the SRF-RE driven luciferase activity, further strengthening physiological interaction between miR-301a and Cfl2. Interestingly, the expression of SRF and its target genes was strikingly increased in Cs1-ko suggesting a possible in vivo correlation between expression levels of Cfl2/miR-301a and SRF activation, which needs to be independently validated. In summary, our data demonstrates that miR-301a regulates Cofilin-2 in vitro in NRVCM, and in vivo in Cs1-ko mice. Our findings provide an additional and important layer of Cfl2 regulation, which we believe has an extended role in cardiac signal transduction and dilated cardiomyopathy presumably due to the reported involvement of Cfl2 in these mechanisms.The muscle LIM protein (MLP) and cofilin 2 (CFL2) are important regulators of striated myocyte function. Mutations in the corresponding genes have been directly associated with severe human cardiac and skeletal myopathies, and aberrant expression patterns have often been observed in affected muscles. Herein, we have investigated whether MLP and CFL2 are involved in common molecular mechanisms, which would promote our understanding of disease pathogenesis. We have shown for the first time, using a range of biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, that MLP binds directly to CFL2 in human cardiac and skeletal muscles. The interaction involves the inter-LIM domain, amino acids 94 to 105, of MLP and the amino-terminal domain, amino acids 1 to 105, of CFL2, which includes part of the actin depolymerization domain. The MLP/CFL2 complex is stronger in moderately acidic (pH 6.8) environments and upon CFL2 phosphorylation, while it is independent of Ca(2+) levels. This interaction has direct implications in actin cytoskeleton dynamics in regulating CFL2-dependent F-actin depolymerization, with maximal depolymerization enhancement at an MLP/CFL2 molecular ratio of 2:1. Deregulation of this interaction by intracellular pH variations, CFL2 phosphorylation, MLP or CFL2 gene mutations, or expression changes, as observed in a range of cardiac and skeletal myopathies, could impair F-actin depolymerization, leading to sarcomere dysfunction and disease.ADF/cofilins drive cytoskeletal dynamics by promoting the disassembly of &quot;aged&quot; ADP-actin filaments. Mammals express several ADF/cofilin isoforms, but their specific biochemical activities and cellular functions have not been studied in detail. Here, we demonstrate that the muscle-specific isoform cofilin-2 promotes actin filament disassembly in sarcomeres to control the precise length of thin filaments in the contractile apparatus. In contrast to other isoforms, cofilin-2 efficiently binds and disassembles both ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin filaments. We mapped surface-exposed cofilin-2-specific residues required for ATP-actin binding and propose that these residues function as an &quot;actin nucleotide-state sensor&quot; among ADF/cofilins. The results suggest that cofilin-2 evolved specific biochemical and cellular properties that allow it to control actin dynamics in sarcomeres, where filament pointed ends may contain a mixture of ADP- and ATP/ADP-Pi-actin subunits. Our findings also offer a rationale for why cofilin-2 mutations in humans lead to myopathies. ",

However, the contributions of RING1 to cancer etiology or development are unknown. In this study, we report that RING1 is a critical negative regulator of p53 homeostasis in human hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas. RING1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase to directly interact with and ubiquitinate p53, resulting in its proteasome-dependent degradation. The RING domain of RING1 was required for its E3 Ub ligase activity. RING1 depletion inhibited the proliferation and survival of the p53 wild-type cancer cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence, with only modest effects on p53-deficient cells. Its growth inhibitory effect was partially rescued by p53 silencing, suggesting an important role for the RING1-p53 complex in human cancer. In clinical specimens of hepatocellular carcinoma, RING1 upregulation was evident in association with poor clinical outcomes. Collectively, our results elucidate a novel PRC1-independent function of RING1 and provide a mechanistic rationale for its candidacy as a new prognostic marker and/or therapeutic target in human cancer.Autophagy is the process of degradation of intracellular proteins through the lysosome. Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins have shown to directly recognize autophagic cargo and also to act as a hub for the phagophore nucleation complex. The TRIM proteins are classically characterized by the presence of an amino-terminal RING domain and a B-box domain followed by a coiled coil domain. Although regarded as ubiquitin E3 ligases, this activity has been shown only for a minor set of the 79 human TRIM proteins. Additionally, the role of each domain in the E3 ligase activity is unknown. We investigated the role of the SPRY and RING domains of the human TRIM49 protein in its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Wild-type and mutant constructs of tagged TRIM49 were expressed in E. coli or mammalian cells, and the autoubiquitination activity of the purified protein was assessed. The purified TRIM49 showed no ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vitro. However, cells transfected with the wild-type or mutant protein showed increased levels of lower mass polyubiquitinated proteins and both proteins copurified with polyubiquitinated proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that the TRIM49 protein plays a role in autophagic protein degradation independently of an ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) plays a vital role in immune signal transduction pathways by acting as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain synthesis. However, the detailed mechanism by which the TRAF6 RING dimer promotes ubiquitin transfer was unknown. Through structural modeling and biochemical analysis, we here show that the TRAF6 RING dimer employs a concerted allosteric mechanism using both subunits of the TRAF6 dimer to promote ubiquitin (Ub) transfer. In particular, we reveal the importance of the C-terminal extension of the TRAF6 RING domain that mediates trans-interactions with the donor-Ub. By analyzing structures and models of E3s in complex with Ub-loaded ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), we further highlight the roles of N-terminal and C-terminal extensions beyond the bona fide RING domains in promoting Ub transfer through engagement with a donor-Ub in cis and in trans, respectively.Germ-line mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, result in familial predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers. The BRCA1 protein has multiple functional domains that interact with a variety of proteins in multiple cellular processes. Understanding the biological consequences of BRCA1 interactions with its binding partners is important for elucidating its tissue-specific tumor suppression function. The Cofactor of BRCA1 (COBRA1) is a BRCA1-binding protein that, as a component of negative elongation factor (NELF), regulates RNA polymerase II pausing during transcription elongation. We recently identified a genetic interaction between mouse Brca1 and Cobra1 that antagonistically regulates mammary gland development. However, it remains unclear which of the myriad functions of Brca1 are required for its genetic interaction with Cobra1. Here, we show that, unlike deletion of Brca1 exon 11, separation-of-function mutations that abrogate either the E3 ligase activity of its RING domain or the phospho-recognition property of its BRCT domain are not sufficient to rescue the mammary developmental defects in Cobra1 knockout mice. Furthermore, deletion of mouse Palb2, another breast cancer susceptibility gene with functional similarities to BRCA1, does not rescue Cobra1 knockout-associated mammary defects. Thus, the Brca1/Cobra1 genetic interaction is both domain- and gene-specific in the context of mammary gland development.RING ubiquitin E3 ligases enclose a RING domain for ubiquitin ligase activity and associated domains and/or conserved motifs outside the RING domain that collectively facilitate their classification and usually reveal some of key information related to mechanism of action. Here we describe a new family of E3 ligases that encodes a RING-H2 domain related in sequence to the ATL and BTL RING-H2 domains. This family, named CTL, encodes a motif designed as YEELL that expands 21 amino acids next to the RING-H2 domain that is present across most eukaryotic lineages. E3 ubiquitin ligase BIG BROTHER is a plant CTL that regulates organ size, and SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF111/ARKADIA is a vertebrate CTL. Basal animal and vertebrate, as well as fungi species, encode a single CTL gene that constraints the number of paralogs observed in vertebrates. Conversely, as previously described in ATL and BTL families in plants, CTL genes range from a single copy in green algae and 3 to 5 copies in basal species to 9 to 35 copies in angiosperms. Our analysis describes key structural features of a novel family of E3 ubiquitin ligases as an integral component of the set of core eukaryotic genes.UHRF1 plays multiple roles in regulating DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation maintenance during DNA replication. The UHRF1 C-terminal RING finger functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase to establish histone H3 ubiquitination at Lys18 and/or Lys23, which is subsequently recognized by DNMT1 to promote its localization onto replication foci. Here, we present the crystal structure of DNMT1 RFTS domain in complex with ubiquitin and highlight a unique ubiquitin binding mode for the RFTS domain. We provide evidence that UHRF1 N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) also binds directly to DNMT1. Despite sharing a high degree of structural similarity, UHRF1 UBL and ubiquitin bind to DNMT1 in a very distinct fashion and exert different impacts on DNMT1 enzymatic activity. We further show that the UHRF1 UBL-mediated interaction between UHRF1 and DNMT1, and the binding of DNMT1 to ubiquitinated histone H3 that is catalyzed by UHRF1 RING domain are critical for the proper subnuclear localization of DNMT1 and maintenance of DNA methylation. Collectively, our study adds another layer of complexity to the regulatory mechanism of DNMT1 activation by UHRF1 and supports that individual domains of UHRF1 participate and act in concert to maintain DNA methylation patterns.The tumor suppressor p53 plays a prominent role in the protection against cancer. The activity of p53 is mainly controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2, which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. However, the regulation of Mdm2 remains not well understood. Here, we show that MARCH7, a RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, physically interacts with Mdm2 and is essential for maintaining the stability of Mdm2. MARCH7 catalyzes LysSeven in absentia (SINA) protein is one subgroup of ubiquitin ligases possessing an N-terminal cysteine-rich really interesting new gene (RING) domain, two zinc-finger motifs, and a C-terminal domain responsible for substrate-binding and dimerization. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the SINA gene family has six members, and we characterize in this study all tomato SINA (SlSINA) genes and the gene products. Our results show that SlSINA genes are differentially regulated in leaf, bud, stem, flower, and root. All SlSINA proteins possess RING-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, exhibiting similar specificity towards the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. SlSINA1/3/4/5/6 are localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas SlSINA2 is exclusively localized in the nucleus. Moreover, all SlSINAs can interact with each other for homo- or hetero-dimerization. The functionality of SlSINA proteins has been investigated. SlSINA4 plays a positive role in defense signalling, as manifested by elicitation of E3-dependent hypersensitive response-like cell death; the other SlSINAs are negative regulator and capable to suppress hypersensitive response cell death. Transgenic tomato plants overexpressing SlSINA2 exhibit pale-green leaf phenotype, suggesting SlSINA2 regulates chlorophyll level in plant cells, whereas transgenic tomato plants overexpressing SlSINA5 have altered floral structure with exserted stigma, implicating SlSINA5 plays a role in flower development.Missense mutations that disrupt the RING domain of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 lead to increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 RING domain is a ubiquitin ligase, whose structure and function rely critically on forming a heterodimer with BARD1, which also harbors a RING domain. The function of the BARD1 RING domain is unknown. In families severely affected with breast cancer, we identified inherited BARD1 missense mutations Cys53Trp, Cys71Tyr, and Cys83Arg that alter three zinc-binding residues of the BARD1 RING domain. Each of these mutant BARD1 proteins retained the ability to form heterodimeric complexes with BRCA1 to make an active ubiquitin ligase, but the mutant BRCA1/BARD1 complexes were deficient in binding to nucleosomes and in ubiquitylating histone H2A. The BARD1 mutations also caused loss of transcriptional repression of BRCA1-regulated estrogen metabolism genes CYP1A1 and CYP3A4; breast epithelial cells edited to create heterozygous loss of BARD1 showed significantly higher expression of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 Reintroduction of wild-type BARD1 into these cells restored CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 transcription to normal levels, but introduction of the cancer-predisposing BARD1 RING mutants failed to do so. These results indicate that an intact BARD1 RING domain is critical to BRCA1/BARD1 binding to nucleosomes and hence to ubiquitylation of histone H2A and also critical to transcriptional repression of BRCA1-regulated genes active in estrogen metabolism.",
